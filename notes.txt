  <h2>Child Seat</h2>

  <p>
    Avoid airline baggage charges and have a child seat ready and waiting for you.
    A convertible car seat can be provided for children weighing 20–40 pounds
    (8–18 kg) and up to 40 inches (101 cm) in height when used in a forward-facing position.
  </p>

  <p>
    Parents of children who have outgrown an infant car seat are encouraged to continue
    using these seats in a rear-facing position until the child reaches the maximum
    height and weight limits allowed for rear-facing use by the seat manufacturer.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Hawaii Only:</strong> Children age 2 but under 4 years old must use a rear-facing
    or forward-facing child passenger restraint system with a harness.
