                        <strong>Agreement between User and Adam Vacations</strong>
                        <p>
                            Adam Vacations is owned and operated by Adam Vacations Pvt. Ltd. ("Adam Vacations", "we", or
                            "us"). This agreement outlines the terms and conditions applicable to the services available
                            on or through the Adam Vacations website, mobile website, and mobile and tablet applications
                            (collectively referred to as the "Site"), and details your responsibilities, thereby
                            limiting the liability of Adam Vacations and its third-party suppliers. These suppliers
                            include, without limitation, airlines, hotels, rental car companies, and other suppliers
                            that provide travel or other services through this Site (such third parties collectively
                            referred to as the "Travel Service Providers"). The Site is intended for personal,
                            non-commercial use.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            BEFORE submitting an account registration form and/or using any of the services on the Site,
                            please read this Agreement carefully. By accessing any area of this Site, users ("users" or
                            "you") agree to be legally bound without limitation, qualification, or change and to abide
                            by these Terms and Conditions, which will constitute our agreement ("Agreement"). You should
                            also read our Privacy Policy, which governs your use of this Site and is referenced in this
                            agreement. If you do not agree with any part of this Agreement, you must discontinue use of
                            this Site. Adam Vacations reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, modify, or
                            alter this Agreement at any time by posting the amended terms on this Site. We recommend
                            that you review these Terms and Conditions periodically. The amended terms shall be
                            effective from and after the date that they are posted on the Site. Additional terms may
                            apply when you book services or participate in sweepstakes or other promotions available on
                            Adam Vacations.

                        </p>
                        <h2><strong>Legal Actions :</strong> Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                        <p>
                            Adam Vacations is committed to customer satisfaction. If you have a problem or dispute, we
                            will try to resolve it. If we are unsuccessful, you may pursue your claim as explained in
                            this section.
                            <br><br>
                            You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any problem, dispute, or claim relating in
                            any way to the Sites and/or any of its related applications or services; any dealings with
                            Adam Vacations, including with our marketing and customer service agents; the purchase, use,
                            or performance of any services or products available through this Site; any representations
                            made by Adam Vacations; or our Privacy Policy (collectively, “Claims”) by providing Notice
                            to Customer Support. Unless prohibited by applicable law, any Claim must be brought within
                            two (2) years from the date on which such Claim arose or accrued. If we are unable to
                            resolve your Claims within 60 days of receipt, you may seek relief through arbitration or
                            small claims court, as set forth below. This informal process is a condition precedent to
                            your ability to initiate a claim in arbitration or small claims court.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and Indian
                            laws, without regard to conflict of laws. All Claims or other matters in dispute between you
                            or any third party and Adam Vacations, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service
                            providers or companies offering products or services through the Site, whether based upon
                            contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the United States
                            and India, without regard to conflict of laws provisions that would result in the
                            application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Mandatory Arbitration</h2>
                        <p>
                            Please read this provision carefully. It requires that any and all claims must be resolved
                            by binding arbitration or in small claims court, and it prevents you from pursuing a class
                            action or similar proceeding in any forum. These limitations apply to any claims against
                            Adam Vacations, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies
                            offering products or services through the Site.
                            <br><br>
                            In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. The
                            arbitrator’s decision is generally final and binding, with no right of appeal. Arbitration
                            procedures are simpler and more limited than court procedures.

                        </p>
                        <h2>Credit Card Chargebacks</h2>
                        <p>
                            As a user, you have the ability to dispute charges with credit card companies
                            ("chargebacks"). If you have a question about a charge on your credit card statement, we
                            encourage you to call Adam Vacations prior to disputing the charge with your credit card
                            company to discuss any questions or concerns about our charges. Adam Vacations will work
                            with you to resolve your concerns. Adam Vacations retains the right to dispute any
                            chargeback that it believes is improper, as described more fully below. Adam Vacations also
                            retains the right to cancel any travel reservation in the event of a chargeback related to
                            that reservation.
                            <br><br>
                            By using our service to make a reservation with a Supplier, you accept and agree to the
                            relevant cancellation policy of that Supplier. The cancellation policy of each reservation
                            is available on our website. Please note that certain rates or special offers are not
                            eligible for cancellation or change. Adam Vacations deems the following chargeback scenarios
                            as improper and retains the right to investigate and rebut any such chargeback claims and to
                            recover the costs of such chargeback claims from you, the User.

                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Chargebacks resulting from non-cancellable reservations in the event that Adam Vacations
                                or the Supplier cannot provide a refund, whether or not the reservation is used.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Chargebacks resulting from charges authorized by family, friends, associates, or other
                                third parties with direct access to your credit card.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Chargebacks arising from the Supplier’s failure to deliver a product or service in a
                                manner that’s consistent with the Supplier’s product description.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Chargebacks resulting from force majeure or other circumstances that are beyond the
                                control of Adam Vacations or its subsidiaries.
                            </li>
